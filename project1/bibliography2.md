Many studies in complexity science have focused on properties such as the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, the two authors explore another property, which they call the property of *community structure*. This property identifies networks in which nodes are joined in tight groups that are then connected to each other loosely. The authors' methods for detecting community structure involve simulation and analysis through traditional computing methods (graph generation) and a brand-new method the authors came up with themselves, involving Freeman's betweenness centrality. All of their findings are tested with computer-generated graphs, and the authors found that the method they invented for detecting community structure actually detects the property with a high degree of success. These conclusions seem supported by the authors' results, as the graph they generated to illustrate how well their method worked versus the traditional method showed a sharp increase in accuracy for their method. There are numerous applications of the work from this study, from food webs to college football.
