Language is complex and constantly evolving; in an attempt to understand the ways in which language evolves, in this report, researchers use a data set of several million Twitter users to track language changes as they happen in the modern era. These researchers introduce a new concept of phonetic contagion between Twitter users across regions to explain the evolution of new phonetic spellings for words. This concept is tested for the strength of its influence via a parametric Hawkes process model (not too sure what this is, but I think that in this case, it measures self-activation, mutual reply, tie strength, and locality as influences on a given user's inclination to start using a new phonetic spelling of a word). In the end, the researchers conclude that geographic locality plays a rather small role, and this conclusion seems to be supported by the model; the goodnesses of fit for the models compared to their expected results do not appear to be strong enough to support the concept of local phonetic contagion.
